# Nexus IQ

Provides source scanning for third partly included libraries. This scan is done during normal development builds as well as marked to be done continuously on builds that have been "released" to production. The latter functionality gives us the ability to more promptly respond to vulnerabilities currently running in production environments as they are found by the Sonatype team and before they are exploited.
